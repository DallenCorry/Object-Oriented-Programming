### Southwest Tech, Software Development, Object Oriented Programming CSCI 1107
This is the repository for the Object Oriented Programming class at STECH.

I am a student at SUU and Southwest Tech, studying Computer Science and Software development.

I am applied in this program because I want to continue developing my skills in order to better collaborate and use the Java language, among others. My end goal is to get a position in a large scale Tech company with developmental technology.
