This Project is for creating a meal calendar that randomly generates a weekly meal plan
and compiles the ingredients from each meal into a succinct shopping list with quantities for each ingredient.

In order to run the project, checkout/download all the files into a folder of your choice, and in that folder create a new folder labeled "calendar"
Extract the .java files into the "calendar" folder (this is your package folder)
keep "Ingredients.txt" in the main folder

Run the main method found in MealCalendarDriver.java.
